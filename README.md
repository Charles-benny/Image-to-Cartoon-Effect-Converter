# Image-to-Cartoon-Effect-Converter
This is About Cartoon effect to images using machine learning techniques covers key concepts like image preprocessing, edge detection with algorithms like Canny, color quantization using k-means clustering, and image smoothing. The project guides you through implementing these steps with OpenCV to create a final cartoon-like image
